## Assignment 1-Kiran Shrestha

### Pandas
--- 
* Pandas is a python library used for data manipulation and analysis.
* It provides two different kinds of data structures:
    1. Series : 1D-array that can hold data of any types like integer, float, string.
    2. Dataframe : 2D data structure that holds data like 2D array or table with rows and columns.
* Uses
    1. For data cleaning
    2. For data visualization
    3. Machine Learning Preparation
    4. For data transformation

### Numpy
---
* Numpy is a python library used for numerical and scientific computing.
* When used for homogeneous data type, it offers improve speed, reduce memory consumption. 
* Uses
    1. For numerical computing
    2. For data cleaning
    3. Linear algebra like matrix multiplication
    4. For data transformation like sorting

### Tensorflow
---
